- In the original template special level-3 sections like "Author Contributions"
  or "Acknowledgements" are not added to outline. We add them to outline as
  level-1 header but still render them as level-3 headers.
- ICML-like bibliography style. In this case, the bibliography slightly differs
  from the one in the original example paper. The main difference is that we
  prefer to use author's lastname at first place to search an entry faster.
- In the original template a lot of vertical space is inserted before and after
  graphics and table figures. It is unclear why so much space are inserted. We
  belive that the reason is how Typst justify content verticaly. Nevertheless,
  we append a page break after "Default Notation" section in order to show that
  spacing does not differ visually.
