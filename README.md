## Issues

### Running Title

1. Runing title should be 10pt above the main text. With top margin 1in it
   gives that a solid line should be located at 62pt. Actual, position is 57pt
   in the original template.
2. Default value between header ruler and header text baseline is 4pt in
   `fancyhdr`. But actual value is 3pt due to thickness of a ruler in 1pt.
